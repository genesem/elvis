## ElViS (Eleventy Vite Svelte with WindiCSS)

Base template for integrating a Vite build with Eleventy, Svelte and WindiCSS.


so use it:

1. `git clone https://github.com/genesem/elvis`

2. `yarn` or `npm install`

3. `make build` to build it, with result in `./dist/`


this stack is used as the base on some web sites:

* https://www.vpsguy.com
* https://www.vgtea.com

etc..

I hope the list will grow. :)

P.S. this thing based heavily on the works of  @fpapado: https://github.com/fpapado/eleventy-with-vite

with some mods from me, like:
CORS configuration, Svelte and WindiCSS integrations.

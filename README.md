## ElViS (Eleventy Vite Svelte with WindiCSS)

Base template for integrating a Vite build with Eleventy, Svelte and WindiCSS.


so use it:

1. `git clone https://github.com/genesem/elvis`

2. `cd elvis`  then: `yarn` or `npm install`

3. `make build` to build it, with result in `./dist/`

note: yes I'm using .makefile and *make* to build it ;)

this stack is used as the base on some web sites:

* https://www.vpsguy.com
* https://www.vgtea.com

etc..

I hope the list will grow. :)

P.S. this thing based heavily on the works of  [@fpapado](https://github.com/fpapado/eleventy-with-vite)

with some mods. from me, like:
CORS configuration, Svelte and WindiCSS integrations.
